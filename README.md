🌀 The Philosophy of My Code<br>
💡 If code was a city, I'd be the urban planner.<br>
🕶 I don’t fix bugs, I rewrite the laws of logic.<br>
🛠 My IDE is not a tool, it’s a battleground.<br>
⚔ I ship code with the precision of a blacksmith forging a blade.<br>
🎭 Sometimes I write code so elegant, even I have to read it twice to believe it.<br>
